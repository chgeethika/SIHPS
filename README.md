## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
```
The system simplifies responsible e-waste disposal by helping users find nearby collection facilities through location services. Users can even take a picture of their e-waste , and a virtual assistant guides them on proper disposal methods, including data wiping for sensitive devices. Educational pop-ups raise awareness about the dangers of improper e-waste disposal, and a reward system incentivizes responsible behavior through points redeemable for various benefits (not shown). Additionally, facilities might have access to real-time analytics dashboards to track operations and environmental impact . This comprehensive approach promotes user convenience, education, and responsible e-waste management practices.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram

The process starts with the client providing a report on the assets and data they are discarding.  The flowchart then splits into two main paths, depending on whether the equipment is working or reusable.
If the equipment is working or reusable, it is then tested and assigned a serial number. It can then either be resold or donated to schools and charities.
If the equipment is not working or reusable, the data is destroyed and then the equipment is separated into parts for specialist downstream recyclers. These recyclers will break down the equipment into its component parts, such as metal, glass, and plastic, which can then be recycled.
The client may also receive a rebate for their e-waste, depending on the type of equipment and the recycling company.

## Technology Stack
E-waste Management Software:It can be built using Python with a framework like Django or Flask for a server-side backend.
Geocoding API Integration
Web-based Portal:It will likely be built using frameworks like React or Angular and Javascript libraries for an interactive experience.
Database: PostgreSQL 15.4 or MySQL 5.7.43 
Secure user authentication and data encryption practices are crucial to protect user information.
The platform should comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
